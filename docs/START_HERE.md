# 🚀 OMONI - Session Quick Start

**You are an expert iOS Swift Developer | Clean Architecture | SwiftUI + SwiftData | iOS 26 | NO Liquid Glass UI for now**

read this .md then let me know if you are ready for new development!

## 📚 Required Reading Before Coding

1. Read this file first: `docs/START_HERE.md`
2. Then read: `docs/swiftui_data_flow_guide.md`
3. If you are changing persisted SwiftData models or adding storage fields, read: `docs/SWIFTDATA_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

> `swiftui_data_flow_guide.md` is part of the project entry point now. Read it before touching SwiftUI code so you align with the app's current mental model for `@Observable`, `@State` lifetime, `.task`, view identity, rendering, and performance-sensitive data flow decisions.

> **This project is built with passion — no shortcuts, no lazy responses.**
> Think hard, write clean code, respect every architecture rule, and bring full effort to every task.
> OMO and Claude are building this together. Match that energy.

## ⚡ Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

### 0. NEVER MAKE COMMITS — Only Suggest the Commit Message
**Claude NEVER runs `git commit`, `git add`, or any git write command.**
When work is complete, only output the suggested commit message so the team can run it himself.

```
❌ git add . && git commit -m "..." → NEVER DO THIS
✅ "Here's the suggested commit message: feat: ..."
```

> Team reviews and commits manually. Claude's job ends at suggesting the message.

---

### 0.1. NEVER RUN BUILDS — Validation Happens on Physical Device
**Claude NEVER runs `xcodebuild`, simulator builds, or any build/launch command.**
Dennis validates changes manually on the physical iPhone and then shares feedback if something needs adjustment.

```swift
❌ xcodebuild -project Omoni.xcodeproj -scheme Omoni build
❌ Run on Simulator / try local build validation
✅ Make the code change, explain it clearly, and wait for device feedback
```

> Build verification is handled manually on the physical device. Do not attempt it from Codex.

---

### 1. Architecture Layers (Post-SwiftData)
```
View → ViewModel → UseCase → Repository → ModelContext (SwiftData)
  ↓        ↓          ↓           ↓              ↓
SD*     SD*        SD*         SD*          SD* Models
Models  Models    Models      Models       (single source of truth)
```

> **Domain entity files deleted.** All layers use SD* types directly (SDUser, SDGroup, SDItemList, etc.)
>
> **Persisted model changes are migration work.** If an `SD*` stored shape changes, route it through the versioned schema + migration plan, not only through the model class edit.

### 2. Layer Boundaries (STRICT)
| Layer | ✅ Can Use | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Presentation** (Views/ViewModels) | SD* models, UseCases, AppDIContainer, @Query | CoreData, NSManagedObjectContext, ModelContext directly, Repositories, *Domain structs |
| **Domain** (UseCases, Protocols) | Pure Swift, Foundation, SD* types | SwiftData @Model directly, SwiftUI, Data layer |
| **Data** (Repositories) | ModelContext, SD* models, Domain protocols | Presentation layer |

- **Views render; ViewModels decide.** Keep derived UI state, display-state mapping, and business/presentation rules out of SwiftUI views. If a view needs conditions like "neutral vs paid vs partial", compute that in the ViewModel (or a dedicated presentation mapper) and pass the result in.
- **NO logic in Views.** Views must not fetch, orchestrate, repair, bootstrap, or "complete" state after presentation. If the screen needs data, fallback loading, selection recovery, async coordination, or flow decisions, that belongs in the ViewModel or below.
- **No quick fixes.** We are building a premium product, not patching demos. Do not solve issues with local hacks, view-side band-aids, duplicated loading paths, or special-case glue code. Prefer the robust architectural fix at the correct layer.

### 3. Dependency Injection (MANDATORY)
```swift
// ✅ CORRECT - Always use AppDIContainer
struct MyView: View {
    @State private var viewModel: MyViewModel

    init(container: AppDIContainer) {
        _viewModel = State(wrappedValue: container.makeMyViewModel())
    }
}

// ❌ WRONG - Never create dependencies directly
struct MyView: View {
    @State private var viewModel = MyViewModel(repository: DefaultUserRepository(...))
}
```

### 4. Threading Rules
- **ViewModels**: `@Observable` + `@MainActor`
- **Repositories**: `MainActor.run { }` wrapping ModelContext operations
- **Async**: Use `async/await` and `withTaskGroup` for concurrent ops

### 5. Form Pattern (KEEP IT SIMPLE)
- **Dumb forms, smart ViewModels.** A form view should mostly render bindings and user actions. Loading categories, payment methods, groups, or other form data belongs in the ViewModel.
- **No patchy bootstrap logic in SwiftUI views.** Avoid stacking `.task`, `Task {}`, `onChange`, and post-render state fixes to "finish" building a form after presentation.
- **Initialize structural UI state up front.** Things like edit-mode expansion, initial detent intent, and default selected context should be decided in `init` or by the ViewModel before the view starts reacting.
- **Prefer one clear loading flow.** For sheets and forms, aim for a single standard loading path instead of several competing async triggers.
- **No rush fixes.** We optimize for stable architecture and predictable SwiftUI data flow, not quick patches. If a flow feels too clever, simplify it.
- **Premium product standard.** Every form/edit flow should feel intentional, maintainable, and production-grade. If a change only "makes it work" but weakens architecture, it is not done.

### 6. View Lifecycle Rule (APPLE-LIKE BY DEFAULT)
- **Views should open light.** Opening a sheet, push view, or modal should not trigger heavy UI-side orchestration. A screen should appear because its state already makes sense, not because the view is racing to repair itself after render.
- **Keep views “dumb” beyond forms too.** This rule applies to any SwiftUI screen, not only editors. Views render state. ViewModels prepare state, load data, and decide the flow.
- **Do not put heavy startup logic in `body` modifiers.** Avoid mixing multiple `.task`, `onAppear`, `onChange`, focus reactions, keyboard toolbars, alerts, and animations when a screen is first mounting. If startup behavior feels busy, move the logic down into the ViewModel or simplify the feature.
- **One responsibility per trigger.** If a screen needs initial data, use one clear load path. If it needs to react to identity changes like `group.id`, use one standard reload path. Do not stack several reactive mechanisms for the same concern.
- **Stability first, polish second.** Keyboard accessories, focus animations, suggestion engines, and similar enhancements should only be layered on top once the base screen is already stable.
- **If you feel tempted to add logic in the View, stop.** Re-check the architecture first and move the responsibility to the ViewModel / UseCase / Repository layer that actually owns it.

## 🔴 Red Flags (Auto-Reject)

```swift
import CoreData                              // ❌ FORBIDDEN in Presentation
@Environment(\.managedObjectContext)         // ❌ FORBIDDEN
let service = UserService(...)               // ❌ Services are DELETED
NSFetchRequest<User>(...)                    // ❌ Use UseCases
context.perform { }                          // ❌ No context in Presentation
class VM: ObservableObject { @Published var } // ❌ FORBIDDEN — use @Observable
```

```swift
.task { await loadSomethingNeededToFixTheScreen() }   // ❌ If this is bootstrap/orchestration logic, move it to the ViewModel
onAppear { repairStateAfterPresentation() }           // ❌ View-side patching is forbidden
Task { await loadGroupsBecauseCallerDidNotPassThem() } // ❌ Fix architecture, don't patch in the View
```

```swift
// ❌ Persisted SwiftData change without schema/migration review
var newStoredField: String

// ❌ Bypassing the versioned persistence path in ModelContainer
let schema = Schema([ ... ])
```

## 🧭 Current Stack

| Concern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Persistence | SwiftData `ModelContext` via `ModelContainer.shared` |
| DI | `AppDIContainer` (singleton, `@MainActor`) |
| ViewModels | `@Observable` + `@MainActor` ✅ |
| Data fetch | Repositories → UseCases → ViewModels / `@Query` in Views |
| UI | SwiftUI, Liquid Glass materials (iOS 26) |
| Testing device | Dennis's iPhone (iOS 26.4) `00008120-000A190218614032` |

## 🧠 UX Intent — Key Behaviours (READ BEFORE TOUCHING THESE VIEWS)

| View | Behaviour | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| `AddItemListView` — create mode | Shows `HeroAmountInputView` (big money input) + description field below it | Dashboard quick-add: user sets a price AND a concept in one shot |
| `AddItemListView` — edit mode | **Hides** `HeroAmountInputView`; description field becomes larger (`.body` font, extra padding) | Money is an **item-level** property. The item list itself has no "price" — the hero input is a create-only shortcut, not a real field |
| `ItemListDetailView` | Never shows `HeroAmountInputView` | Same reason — money lives on items, not on the list |

---

## 🔔 Shared Helpers (ALWAYS use before creating new ones)

| Helper | File | Usage |
|--------|------|-------|
| `PressHapticButtonStyle` | `Infrastructure/Helpers/PressHapticButtonStyle.swift` | `.buttonStyle(PressHapticButtonStyle())` |
| `AnimationHelper.smoothSpring` | `Infrastructure/Helpers/AnimationHelper.swift` | General transitions |
| `AnimationHelper.quickSpring` | same | Immediate feedback |
| `AnimationHelper.quickEase` | same | View mode switching |
| `AppConstants.UserInterface.padding` | `Infrastructure/Constants/AppConstants.swift` | 16pt standard padding |
| `AppConstants.UserInterface.cornerRadius` | same | 16pt corner radius |

---

## 💡 Adding a New Feature (post-SwiftData)

1. Add SD* model or extend existing in `Data/SwiftData/`
2. Create/update Repository protocol in `Domain/Protocols/Repositories/`
3. Implement in `Data/Repositories/Default*.swift`
4. Create UseCase in `Domain/UseCases/`
5. Add factory method to `AppDIContainer`
6. Create `@Observable` ViewModel
7. Create View using `@State` + DI container

---

## ⚠️ Don't Over-Engineer

Fix at the lowest layer that makes sense. Don't cascade a change through all layers unless truly required.

---

## 🧪 Unit Tests

**Target:** `OmoniTests` — XCTest + SwiftData in-memory (`OmoniTests/`)
**Run:** `Cmd+U` in Xcode (UI Tests disabled from scheme — they're slow and test nothing useful yet)

### What layer is tested

| Layer | Tested? | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain / UseCases** | ✅ Yes | Real use case + real repository backed by in-memory SwiftData |
| **Data / Repositories** | ✅ Indirectly | Exercised through UseCases via `SwiftDataTestContainer` |
| **Infrastructure / Cache** | ✅ Yes | `CacheManager` directly |
| **Presentation / ViewModels** | ❌ No | Logic lives in UseCases; ViewModels are coordinators only |
| **Views** | ❌ No | Validated manually on physical device |

### Test files

```
OmoniTests/
├── TestHelpers/
│   └── SwiftDataTestContainer.swift     ← in-memory container + seed helpers (insertGroup, insertItemList, insertItem...)
├── Cache/
│   └── CacheManagerTests.swift          ← 11 tests: store/retrieve/clear/expiry/type safety
└── Domain/UseCases/
    ├── CreateGroupUseCaseTests.swift     ← 5 tests: validation, trim, uppercase currency
    ├── FetchCategoriesUseCaseTests.swift ← 5 tests: group scoping, ordering
    ├── CreateItemUseCaseTests.swift      ← 10 tests: creation, trim, quantity, all validation errors
    ├── CalculateItemListTotalsUseCaseTests.swift ← 12 tests: paid status, totals, search items, cache
    └── ItemUseCaseTests.swift            ← 8 tests: delete (target isolation, notFound), toggle paid (bulk, scope)
```

### Rules for new tests
- **Add a test every time you fix a real bug** — the failing test is proof the bug existed and won't return
- **Never mock the repository** — use `SwiftDataTestContainer` (in-memory SwiftData) for real persistence behavior
- **Don't test ViewModels** — if logic needs testing, it belongs in a UseCase, not a ViewModel
- **One `SwiftDataTestContainer` per test class** — created in `setUp`, destroyed in `tearDown` for full isolation

Finally, when the user says "ok, doc and commit" meaning you have to document in english the changelog.md and give the commit name. This is an example: refactor: mark all repositories @MainActor, remove MainActor.run wrappers [v1.0.53] Never make you the commits.
